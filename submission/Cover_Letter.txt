Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "A Lightweight World Model–Assisted PPO Framework for Efficient Reinforcement Learning in MuJoCo Environments" for consideration for publication in Advanced Robotics.

In this work, we address the critical challenge of sample inefficiency in Deep Reinforcement Learning for robotic control. We propose a novel framework that integrates a lightweight World Model with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike existing heavy probabilistic models, our approach introduces minimal computational overhead while significantly accelerating convergence through dual mechanisms: structured latent representation and intrinsic auxiliary rewards.

Our key contributions include:
1.  A streamlined Encoder-Dynamics architecture that improves sample efficiency by 20-30% on standard MuJoCo benchmarks.
2.  A detailed ablation study demonstrating the impact of latent dimensionality and auxiliary reward weighting.
3.  Qualitative analysis of the learned latent space, revealing that the model captures meaningful physical semantics of robotic gaits.

We believe this work is well-suited for the readership of Advanced Robotics as it bridges the gap between theoretical RL advancements and practical, efficient robotic control algorithms.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
